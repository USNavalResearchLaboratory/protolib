Generating doxygen output on Windows:

1. Make sure the doc/doxygen/Doxyfile configuration file points to the correct location
   of graphwiz's "dot" exectuable for your system. (DOT_PATH variable)
2. Load the doxygen configuration file (doc/doxygen/Doxyfile) into the 
   doxygen wizard.
3. Start, output will be put in /doc/doxygen/html.

Generating doxygen output on Linux:

1. Make sure the doc/doxygen/Doxyfile file points to the correct location of
   graphwiz's "dot" exectuable for your system.  (DOT_PATH variable)
2. Run "doxygen doxyfile", output will be put in /doc/doxygen/html
3. Rumor has it that there is a doxygen wizard (gui) available for linux.

Supplemental Documentation

Supplemental documentation (e.g. Introduction, Summarized class list by
category etc. are stored in the doc/doxygen/mainpages directory.

How to document classes:

/**
 * @class ClassName
 * 
 * @brief Enter a brief description of the
 * class, the first sentence (deliminated by a period)
 * will be included in the brief description.
 *
 * Anything after the first sentence, and included
 * in the "@class" block will be part of the
 * detailed description.
 *
 * The "@brief" description will be used to
 * describe the class on the class list.
 *
 */

How to document functions:
--------------------------

Keep the Doxygen function documentation with the function definition, e.g. in 
either the .h or the .cpp file.

Placing "/**" before the comments will cause Doxygen to generate a link
to the function documentation.  

/**
 *
 * @brief Description of the function.  Will appear before function
 * definition.  Don't really need "@brief" as JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF is 
 * turned on.
 *
 * @param Defailed parameter text, if needed.  Will appear in
 * separate parameter secion.
 *
 * @retval Detailed text about return value, if needed.
 *
 */
void someFunc() {}

Placing "///" before the comments will cause Doxygen to include the 
associated text next to the function name in the function listing only.
 
 
Other Notes:

1.  Sometimes the html directory has to be cleared out and the entire
doxygen output regenerated if the graphics get screwed up.

2.  Need "dot" from graphwiz.  In some doxygen implementations it is
included.

3.  Can generate called/call graphs.  To enable or disable call graphs
for each function, toggle CALL_GRAPH and CALLER_GRAPH variables in the
config file.  To enable for specific functions when CALL_GRAPH is set
to no, use the @callgraph/@callergraph commands.

4. @sa "See also" alias.
   @note "Note" alias
   @exception 
   @class
   @param
   @return
   @retval

  ProtoGraph::~Vertice has an example of function text and a @note.

5.  Can turn off documentation of inherited functions and properties.

8.  We are generating documentation from all src files included under
the doc tree.  This can be changed to include/exclude specific directories.

Modify INPUT in config file to add additional code/directories, e.g.

INPUT = ../common

#Add protolib to the doxygen output
#INPUT += ../../protolib/common 

#To add files
#INPUT += ../../protolib/common/protoApp.h ../../protolib/common/protoApp.cpp
